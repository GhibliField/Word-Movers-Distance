tennis-12#rusedski angry over supplements greg rusedski has criticised the governing body of mens tennis for not releasing contaminationfree supplements in time for the new season rusedski said i tried to order some but didnt receive any and i havent got any yet you would think they would have been available in december as it can take two months for the body to respond this event comes in the hottest period of the year so you would hope the stuff would be available for it the british number two escaped a possible ban last year when he persuaded a tribunal that a positive doping test was the result of contaminated atp supplements in response the atp struck a deal with pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline to provide contaminationfree drinks and nutritional bars for the mens tour david higdon vice president of the atp admitted i agree with greg i would have loved to have had these things available as soon as possible but its a lot of work to make sure they have gone through rigorous testing the reality is though that the first two weeks of the tour are spread far and wide and part of the distribution agreement we had with gsk has an education component we werent going to just drop these products out there without having a talk with the players about understanding how to use them the first chance we will get to do that is at the players meeting on the saturday before the australian open and rusedski who takes on roger federer at the qatar open later on wednesday conceded that the imminent changes will be beneficial the good thing is that there is now a 100 guarantee so hopefully all this will never happen again said rusedski hopefully after the australian open we wont have to discuss this any more
football-13#tv calls after carroll error spurs boss martin jol said his team were robbed at manchester united after pedro mendes shot clearly crossed the line but was not given the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why cant we just stop the game and get the decision right said jol after the 00 draw but at the end of the day its so obvious that pedros shot was over the line its incredible we feel robbed but its difficult for the linesman and referee to see it mendes shot from 50 yards and united goalkeeper roy carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear jol added we are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line it was a metre inside the goal what really annoys me is that we are here in 2005 watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isnt told about it we didnt play particularly well but i am pleased even now with a point although we should have had three mendes could not believe the goal was not given after seeing a replay he said my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate it was a very nice goal it was clearly over the line ive never seen one so over the line and not given in my career its really really over what can you do but laugh about it its a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didnt count its not every game you score from the halfway line manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology i think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and thats that technology should play a part in the game ferguson told mutv what i was against originally was the time factor in video replays but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee cant make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a freekick or take a corner or a goalkick so you wouldnt be wasting a lot of time i think you could start off by using it for goalline decisions i think that would be an opening into a new area of football arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford that just reinforces what i feel there should be video evidence said wenger its a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal

rugby-26#dallaglio his own man to the end controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career even the end of his nineyear career came out of the blue just four days before the start of the season but then dallaglio has always been his own man ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions to supporters of england dallaglio could do no wrong an integral part of a sustained period of success for england dallaglios crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in 2003 rival fans meanwhile have tended to take an alternative view seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby never afraid to speak his mind be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch or his coach or the media off it dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in 1993 it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv but once there he proved to the manor born displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three backrow positions at international standard within two years of his debut dallaglio was offered the england captains band and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 lions tour to south africa although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england teammate martin johnson he played a massive role in the 21 series victory but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum dallaglios career hit the buffers at speed in 1999 first came the lastminute defeat to wales in which dallaglios decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy with sensational allegations of drug use of which he was subsequently cleared splashed across the front pages a devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper but he bounced back getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain johnson as a member of a newlook england side on the long road to world cup glory a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again yet another setback arrived in 2001 as a serious knee injury cut short dallaglios involvement on the lions tour to australia rumours began to circulate that his career was over but in typical dallaglio style he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace but ever the pragmatist he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre the only player to play every minute of englands world cup triumph in australia dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure englands historic win and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters following johnsons retirement dallaglios career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain while england did not hit the heights in dallaglios second spell as captain losing five of their eight postworld cup tests dallaglio led by example leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of englands most accomplished players if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable the likes of matt dawson jonny wilkinson phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglios role as captain but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the 32yearold although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up the fact that there is no standout candidate speaks volumes about dallaglios massive influence on english rugby

athletics-33#athens memories soar above lows well its goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens obviously theres no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe but i want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember or forget for athletics one of my favourite olympic moments was kellys success in the 800m winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality kelly had been full of should i shouldnt i thoughts about going for the double in athens i thought why wouldnt you do the 800m its your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story the victory for the british mens 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games i think the four of them jason gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark lewisfrancis knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake hicham el guerroujs olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kellys on a global scale he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5000m titles as soon as he had added the 5000m crown and i had finished commentating i jumped up ran down the stairs pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with even though my french and his english are not very good what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10000m five days later was not wise that was her heart and not her head reacting paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day things like niggling injuries not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained and if even the smallest thing doesnt feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall the positive thing to take from paulas olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people including me purely as a race paulas victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling it was so nipandtuck between her and kenyas susan chepkemei and you dont usually get that kind of excitement in marathons it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words paula showed real bouncebackability and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out kelly and the 4x100m boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team we should be concerned that were not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level the only individual mens finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed and thats where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb the thing is if we dont have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesnt look good for the beijing olympics and beyond i tell you what i really enjoyed this year benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march in the absence of paula we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special to be honest im getting bored with all the drug scandals especially balco i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on having said that im always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it

football-37#nike defends underfire football nike has defended its premiership ball after it was blamed for a spate of goalkeeping errors england coach ray clemence and arsenal legend bob wilson criticised the nike total 90 aerow balls flightpath but corporate communications manager simon charlesworth told bbc sport theres some minor criticism which i think have been slightly exaggerated overall everything ive heard has been very positive the ball is more accurate if anything arsenal pair jens lehmann and manuel almunia liverpools jerzy dudek and manchester uniteds roy carroll have been criticised for recent errors clemence who played for england 61 times believes the ball is partly to blame i certainly feel the ball is a major factor in mistakes happening he told the daily mail newspaper but you will always get the very best keeper making the odd error and of course they are always highlighted wilson who kept goal in arsenals doublewinning team in the 1970s says papa bouba diops goal for fulham against manchester united in midweek highlighted the problem he said we are not talking here about the ability of a david beckham or a roberto carlos to actually bend the ball but lads who just welly it for goal the ball now goes either to the right or left or up or down and theres no way you can judge which way it will go but charlesworth says the ball which is also used in the spanish topflight is one of the most accurate on the market he added at the beginning of the season the ball was presented to every manager and as many players as we could reach the majority have been very happy to use it the ball has been designed with three things in mind making it faster more accurate and more visible and all of that in order to bring more excitement to the game its truer weve tried to make it as round as possible with old balls the technology didnt allow you to do what you can do now you might have had weight over to one side you might have seaming the bladder might have not sat in the right way so you could hit one half of the ball and it would do crazy things in the air the idea here is weve created everything perfectly even across the circumference of the ball it may be that skilled players are able to create things they intended to do easier this is where its getting difficult because people are saying it moved in the air its not the fault of the ball its how the player has kicked the ball to make it move in the air because its a truer ball and it allows you to do that it might be that they are intending that it certainly doesnt move around like a remote control bumble bee or something it goes the way it is kicked

into the deep marcus trescothick was the first to go after england lost the toss caught behind off makhaya ntini 341 mark butcher then played on and andrew strauss was caught at midoff for 25 pollock is given the task of capturing the final two england wickets england 1258 an authentic boundary next ball lashed over cover for four more next ball jones tries to duck a bouncer and the ball barely gets above stump height glancing the top of his head and bringing four leg byes jones stands up to steyn and pushes through the gap at midoff for two boje tosses one up from over the wicket and jones has a dart at it not finding the middle of the bat but smearing through a vacant midon for a single after the pace barrage boje returns and hoggard finds a single to leave new man simon jones on strike the giles vigil ends in disappointing fashion as severely hampered he hooks at steyn and the man at deep squareleg does not have to move favouring the back foot as steyn continues to steam in hoggard is glad to see one of fullish length that he can push out for a single after a single is scrambled hoggard moves into the firing line and just manages to avoid a rapidly rising bouncer another part of unprotected giles anatomy is battered at 85mph steyns skidding short one catching him in the armpit hoggard jabs down at the final moment to keep out a yorker from kallis that was destined for the timbers an appeal begun only by the keeper for caught behind against giles down the legside increases a little in volume but darrel hair is not impressed hoggard does not know too much about a full and fast delivery which he inside edges to fineleg for a single giles hooks uncomfortably again with one hand off the bat but the single gives him temporary reprieve from the hostile steyn the return of kallis is warmly greeted by giles who clips a loosener neatly off his pads for four matthew hoggard is the latest casualty another short one from the aggressive steyn thwacking into his arm guard the next ball is also short and giles plays an unconvincing hook with one hand coming off the bat but some contact is made and giles is grateful to stutter through for a single giles is thumped again by another short one giles ducks into a brutal low bouncer from steyn the ball crashes into his elbow and loops over the slip for four leg byes steyn returns for pollock as south africa look to wrap up the innings the hook proves to be the undoing of jones who picks out rudolph in the deep off ntini jones edges low through a gap where fourth slip would have been bringing four urgently needed runs for england another hook goes high into the space in front of square but determined fielding from rudolph restricts jones to two persisting with the hook shot jones is fully in control but can only get a single to deep squareleg off pollock jones hooks uppishly at ntini and is within 10 yards of carrying to the fielder on the fineleg boundary aiming an expansive drive into the offside he gets an inside edge and escapes with a single jones pummels a cut shot off pollock into the boards for his second four vaughan is rapped on the pads bang in front by a skidding delivery from ntini and umpire taufel confirms his worst fears pollock unsettles vaughan with a bouncer that follows him and catches the glove a controlled thick edge from jones finds the gap between third slip and gully and races for four ntini returns his first delivery down the legside and easily turned for a single by vaughan geraint jones picks up a short one from pollock and the ball soars over the ropes for the maximum to open the wicketkeepers account in emphatic fashion vaughan rocks back to guide a forcing shot for a much needed boundary off boje flintoff is beaten for pace by pollock and his hook shot loops up tamely off the splice to square leg to leave his team in turmoil vaughan appears to lose sight of a short one from pollock and having planned to leave it fends it awkwardly with the glove before scrambling through for a risky single vaughan is able to pinch a single as his gentle push on the off side defeats the fielder on the bounce thorpe is trapped plumb in front by the metronomic pollock boje resumes after the interval vaughan crashes one into jacques rudolph at silly point but slices the next ball through gully for four england 583 vaughan and thorpe get through safely to lunch but know that much more will be required this afternoon vaughan badly needing to play a major innings strikes a fluent boundary off boje kallis switches ends and produces a maiden as england look towards the safety of the luncheon interval new man graham thorpe clips a single from the final ball of the over the single proves effective as key man strauss takes the strike and lofts a catch to extra cover where ntini swoops low to cap a fine morning for the home side boje finds some early spin with his third delivery and catches the edge of vaughans bat as the england captain pushes forward but de villiers spills the chance and the ball falls to safety kallis is replaced after two overs and the spin of nicky boje is tried 13 minutes before lunch there is nothing to stop a strauss cut shot which brings up the england 50 in the 24th over strauss is denied a certain boundary when his pull shot strikes squareleg umpire simon taufel kallis escapes with a maiden as a sumptuous looking drive from vaughan goes straight to the ubiquitous amla in the covers strauss strokes the next ball gloriously down the ground for his fourth boundary vaughan pirouettes to pull steyn stylishly but only for a single as the distinctive figure of amla fields on the squareleg fence strauss eases the pressure a little by bisecting the field with a trademark drive to the boundary as kallis struggles to find his rhythm early on jacques kallis is introduced having been unable to bowl in the first test or in india his first delivery is easily clipped into the legside for vaughans first run more conviction in this pull shot from strauss and steyn is dispatched to the boundary just a single from the over a hook from strauss who moves to nine michael vaughan is given a bouncer first up and survives an optimistic shout for lbw an inside edge onto the stumps off steyn ends butchers innings in disappointing fashion again a nicely timed cover drive brings butcher three runs with the intrepid amla cutting the ball off a yard inside the ropes ntini replaces pollock who is left to fume in the outfield his face a light shade of crimson steyn completes his second maiden restricting butcher with an accurate offstump line pollock hurls the ball back at strauss and throws in a few choice words for good measure the extra bounce of durban provides some uncertainty for strauss an attempted cut and hook bouncing too high for him dale steyn is brought into the attack and herschelle gibbs provides him with a maiden with an agile diving stop in the gully butcher has to scamper through as he attempts a quick single to amla who is quicker than perhaps the lefthander gives him credit for luckily for him the throw is a fraction high an elegant drive on the tips of his toes from strauss through midoff gives him his first boundary mark butcher nudges ntini into the legside to open his account pollock maintains the south africa stranglehold with another over offering no easy runs a stunning onehanded catch by de villiers off an inside edge ends trescothicks bright innings strauss gets down to ntinis end and is happy to receive a ball on the pads which he clips neatly away through squareleg for three trescothick slashes a wide one from ntini not quite out of the middle but there is enough on it to clear nicky boje in the gully and race for four strauss looks for a single after driving to the right of hashim amla but the fielder gets across well and ensures another maiden the wild ntini produces a maiden the final ball of the over keeping low and bouncing in front of wicketkeeper ab de villiers strauss keen to get off the mark attempts a drive at pollock outside offstump but misses and it is another maiden ntini asks the question of darrell hair but trescothick is a long way forward he clips the next ball off his pads for two more another probing maiden from pollock with strauss content to remain on nought and leave them outside his offstump trescothick thumps the final ball of ntinis over through the covers into the boundary boards pollock maintains a tidy line outside offstump to strauss who is yet to get off the mark trescothick picks the gap at midoff punching ntini for the days first boundary ntini bowling over the wicket angles a short ball across trescothick who does not take the bait pollock overpitches as trescothick gets the scoring under way for england with an offdrive for three runs graeme smith captain herschelle gibbs jacques rudolph jacques kallis martin van jaarsveld hashim amla ab de villiers shaun pollock nicky

football-43#the gloves are off when arsenal play manchester united on tuesday a fixture that is usually a titledecider has this time been relegated to undercard status both teams will be playing for pride and hoping for a win to seize on any possible hiccup by premiership leaders chelsea arsenal and united have been left in the slipstream of the stamford bridge outfit and the reason according to many experts is goalkeeping woes while chelsea keeper petr cech who the gunners missed out on signing has conceded only eight league goals so far this season his rivals have had their quality questioned after highprofile mistakes and misdemeanours arsenal have let in 24 goals as jens lehmann has been dropped in favour of manuel almunia who has failed to convince the doubters despite holding highburys number one jersey roy carroll has wrestled the firstteam keeper spot at united from tim howard whose errors cost him his place but he still has doubts hanging over his credentials its like a heartbreak for goalkeepers like me and peter shilton exgunners keeper bob wilson told bbc radio five lives sportsweek programme in assessment of the general level of goalkeeping at present shilton is englands mostcapped player and he believes the lack of topclass keepers is a reason for the predicament at arsenal and united they are adequate he said you look around and there are not too many other goalkeepers who you would think were better arsenal manager arsene wenger and his old trafford counterpart sir alex ferguson have tried in vain to find new players of a similar quality to replace david seaman and peter schmeichel seaman was at arsenal for 13 years while schmeichel was at old trafford for eight years and was hailed as the bargain of the century by ferguson after he signed him for 600000 wilson and shilton have cited the lack of technique of the current generation but both agree they would have lehmann in goal ahead of almunia at arsenal wilson explained i would defend jens lehman last season because he was top of every stat going he had an absolutely phenomenal season but unfortunately a couple of big errors came in the champions league against chelsea and arsene is a hard taskmaster and so he suddenly started to change and take a real chance on the spaniard lehmann has excellent basic technique and young almunia is still learning the game i believe at the moment lehmann has an advantage over almunia but the man who is paid to make those decisions and thats arsene will continue to play almunia shilton echoed lehmann did well arsenal were unbeaten for so many games and he was very consistent but the minute he made one or two mistakes and people got on to his back he seemed to lose a bit of confidence arsenal and united could have better goalkeepers but those they have got are not doing too badly they are making the odd one or two serious errors and the spotlight is going to be on them but they have to put it to the back of their minds and roll their sleeves up former arsenal manager george graham brought seaman to highbury and he has his own theory he said i would disagree with bob and peter about technique i think decisionmaking from the majority of goalkeepers ive seen this season is the problem
football-44#odriscoll concern at fifa ruling bournemouth boss sean odriscoll is concerned at the impact that the transfer window system could make if it is applied to football league clubs next season the league was recently informed by fifa that its 72 clubs would no longer receive any further dispensation to trade players outside the world governing bodys transfer windows after the end of the current campaign the matter will now be discussed at the next meeting of all clubs on 10 march when a league working party set up to consider the implications of fifas decision is set to report back the clubs will then decide on the next step to take league communications executive ian christon confirmed if it is applied to the football league odriscoll feels the fifaimposed system could harm the chances for young players at premiership clubs to gain experience in the lower leagues when injuries have struck odriscoll has used the shortterm loan market to bolster his small squad a move which is not possible under the window ruling which currently just applies to the premiership and prevents the transfer of players during the season except during the month of january i dont think it benefits anyone in the football industry in england the cherries boss told bbc sport we took john spicer from arsenal this season while last saturdays opponents oldham have taken a few including neil kilkenny from birmingham kilkenny looks a really good player but was never going to play in the premiership so where will these players go if you dont have the finance to buy them they get stuck in the reserves i watch an awful lot of reserve team games and you can tell the players who have been there too long as it doesnt motivate them and they go through the motions it becomes extremely difficult to try and pick them as you think if i get him out of there could he cope in the football league so it doesnt benefit the big clubs and doesnt benefit the small clubs weve got to come in line with the rest of europe but itll cause us major problems as we live on a knifeedge however odriscoll accepts that with the loan market blocked clubs such as bournemouth will have to look to their own youth ranks when injuries begin to bite the better youth systems will play an important part and youll have even younger boys being part of the firstteam squad he explained weve got two 17yearolds in our squad whove come through the youth system james coutts and james rowe and im sure well have four or five next year just so they can train with the first team next year if needed youre going to have to throw them in even if you have the finance to bring in a loan player you wont be allowed i think there will be a mad scramble come the end of the transfer window to strengthen squads

athletics-47#record fails to lift lacklustre meet yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking a world record apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at 5m in competition mind you every time she breaks the record she gets 30000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it world records aside i thought it was a very encouraging evenings work for kelly holmes she looked good and was very positive agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the worlds top three 800m runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last 200m as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasnt convinced herself she is fit enough to do so on the other hand i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the mens 60m in madrid he started well in the final but still could not stay with the frontrunners jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish it would have been nice to see what mark lewisfrancis could have done in the final if only he hadnt got himself disqualified he was blatantly playing the falsestart game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly my view is youre meant to go when the gun goes and not before and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the falsestart tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again having said that mark is looking in much better shape but i havent seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests frances ronald pognon who has run 645 seconds will be under threat at the europeans from a british point of view sarah claxtons victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the womens national 400m race in a new personal best of 5298 seconds aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the european championships scotlands lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal from an international perspective i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the 3000m but i dont think the pacemaking was great canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last years shape she would have given defar a real run for her money she had a go but just could not hang in there we were also expecting a bit more from bernard lagat in the mens 1500m but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season it was very hot in the national indoor arena and i felt uncomfortable in the commentary box i think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly

football-88#fa cup losing its sheen the fa cup used to be sacrosanct regardless of the demands on the top teams they would always field their strongest teams in the fa cup nobody messed about with the fa cup and it is disappointing that this has changed it has all come about from the number of competitions that the top sides enter and the amount of games they play in a season im not saying there are necessarily more competitions but more teams play in europe and the champions league is fixture intensive foreign coaches in particular seem to want to rest more players in the fa cup they probably dont realise the stature and long history of the competition the champions league is the main competition for the top managers followed by the premiership and the fa cup comes in a poor third i think this is bound to affect the way in which people view the competition and it takes some of the gloss off burnleys brilliant victory over liverpool liverpool boss rafael benitez fielded a lot of their youngsters who usually play in the reserves and burnley were justifiable winners they played some good football were well organised and had too much experience for their opponents i think the majority of championship teams are now too good for premiership reserve sides nonetheless as a manager of a championship team i would always rather play a fullstrength premiership team obviously coming up a side without many firstchoice players increases your chances of winning the tie but you want to play against the big names as burnley boss steve cotterill correctly pointed out liverpool had some good players in their team but it was not a fullstrength side and that tarnishes the result the glory is not quite the same by not playing their first team it almost gives liverpool an excuse for going out i was delighted that aston villa played their best side when we played them our victory along with burnleys win on tuesday sunderlands victory over crystal palace and west hams defeat of norwich is good news for the championship it shows the quality that is within the championship and how little difference there is between the top clubs in the division and the lowerend premiership clubs finally this week a word on the dispute between sir alex ferguson and arsene wenger there have been calls for a summit to end the row but if im honest i have to say i enjoy reading about it alex and arsene are two experienced managers who know what they are doing and i say let them get on with it the big winner from all of this is chelsea boss jose mourinho i really enjoy watching his postmatch news conferences and he has been a breath of fresh air in the premiership manchester united and arsenal have had it their own way for so long that it is good to have a new kid on the block

athletics-140#european medal chances improve what have the european indoor trials told us well i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxtons win in the 60m hurdles running subeight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal but what was great about sundays performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah and knowing that she got the better of diane in a headtohead race will give sarah confidence in the mens race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him in fact the mens 60m hurdles is so strong i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of 1730m which puts him at the top of the world rankings i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him but then phillips always has a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and 60m hurdles and you cant ask for more than that kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what weve seen so far she has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well it wasnt all good news in sheffield i thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways jason gardener may have won but he wasnt at his best i chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an offday for him hes there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there in the womens race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka the pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with a chest infection if she had made the final i think jeanette would have gone a bit quicker janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a twoyear drugs ban but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldnt be the case the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her a couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain yusuf who came third in the 400m is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent so we shall have to see what happens to both of them

football-143#hodgson relishes european clashes former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have a winter break but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elites bid for champions league glory hodgson now in charge at viking stavanger was at liverpools clash with bayer leverkusen at anfield on tuesday as a member of uefas technical committee hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe although not in england where the champions league contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list but hodgson told bbc sport that while he believes the premiership should embrace the idea he does not expect it to cost the english representatives in the last 16 of the champions league i just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge i am a fervent supporter of the break it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league the other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages explaining as i said it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries and certainly if i was still a manager in england i would be supporting any calls for its introduction in preseason you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot find themselves getting very jaded the break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and perhaps more importantly recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead the mental side is by far the most important thing hodgson added the length of breaks can vary in italy the break was very short you just took christmas and new year it was so short you didnt do anything you gave the players a week or 10 days off then you were training for a week or 10 days and then went into a game if it is longer it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them and hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the premiership he said if we talk about football at elite level which the premiership is then i would support a winter break if you examine the demands of the premier league and in particular on players who play international football for their club and country then a break would do them the world of good physically and mentally

not accept offers but we are also realistic enough to know we cant keep steven against his will on the subject of liverpools finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from a similar role at the premier league there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield and he had a busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard on the subject of liverpools captain and prize asset parry revealed real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes he said they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid was the same steven is not for sale but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said i sincerely hope he will be steven knows my views he knows rafas views we have reaffirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him we crave success as much as he does we know hes ambitious and nobody can argue with that i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than hed like to do anything else we all want to see progress by next season hes not alone in that there are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a 30mplus bid in the summer but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen there have been a lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer we didnt had an offer last summer parry explained we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didnt want to sell him in reality it didnt go beyond that maybe there will be an offer in the summer maybe there wont our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven and he has enough respect for us to know that it is his decision that will be crucial you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will that just doesnt work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way weve decided to sell you is not on the agenda you can forget that parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpools new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in 2007 and he confessed arsenals 100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground complete with naming rights has given the anfield club serious food for thought he said i have to say historically it is something i have been against and i have been on record as saying that but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eyeopener i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasnt even been worth contemplating but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow thats interesting my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but parry countered i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it time will tell i think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship i think it would be remiss not to thats not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but i think it is clearly something we have to explore on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board he also accused liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained steve has never been used as a stalking horse theres no need and that is not the way we do business we had discussions with steve over the course of 2004 i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didnt happen quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it we are still evaluating it steves interest was taken very much on its own merits his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold the door isnt closed on anything we had a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year we have a common interest in making liverpool successful thats a dream we all share so as far as im concerned the door is not closed i would take 50m if we had no investment but if we did keep him as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really 50m for gerrard i dont care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrards quality through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think is the right thing to do critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term i am hoping he doesnt walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash 50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it i would however be happy with gerrards transfer for any fee over 35m parrys statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players upping the ante is another smart move by parry i would keep gerrard no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy clearly if he isnt then we would be foolish not to sell the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible nonchampions league football

football-183#owen may have to return home michael owen has delivered the first hint that he may consider his future away from real madrid if he fails to get regular firstteam football and noone can blame him owen displayed his worldclass ability once again with another goal after coming on as a substitute in reals win at osasuna on sunday and therein lies his problem michael may have made a rod for his own back with his fantastic performances coming on as substitute his many coaches at real madrid may have decided this is his best role if that is the case that is no good to him and he will be coming home sooner rather than later michael must hope his performances earn him a regular starting opportunity and you can rest assured he will take that chance when it comes i said when he was on the bench earlier this season that michaels pride would ensure he stuck it out he would not want to be branded a failure but he is still on the bench and we are into february and he could leave now and noone could call him a flop after the terrific performances he has turned in if and when he decides to leave i dont think he will go elsewhere in europe i think he will come back to the premiership and there would be no shortage of takers in an ideal world i would obviously love to see him return to liverpool but you can rest assured that arsenal and chelsea would consider what michael owen could offer them as well owen is a great goalscorer but he is also a very good footballer as well but one thing that is vital to michaels game is sharpness and he will know himself that you miss a vital ingredient when you are not starting games also michael is a fine professional who did not sign for real madrid to sit on the sidelines no matter how many galacticos are around him i would expect some serious interest should he fail to win a regular place chelsea have given the lie to claims that they are enjoying good fortune in their quest for the title but they will do well just to have a look in their rearview mirror at manchester united sir alex ferguson played the mind games by suggesting chelsea would struggle in the north but theyve answered that one they beat blackburn who didnt half put a foot in against them and then came through a real tough one at everton albeit aided by james beatties sending off chelsea have done brilliantly and you do not keep clean sheets like they do by luck alone but all manchester united can do is keep up the pressure and boy are they doing that no team has ever been better at chasing down the leaders than manchester united fergusons team will stay totally committed to the cause it is still very much chelseas to lose and they have shown they can battle as well as play exhilarating football so the odds must be on them but the old liverpool saying was that you have never won the title until the medal is in your hand and united will still have their sights set on snatching them away from chelsea the big talking point of the weekend was beatties sending off for everton against chelsea ive got to confess ive never seen anything like that i cant defend the lad or condone it but you can almost see how it has happened he has come out fired up but its all gone wrong it was right in front of the referee and its the most straightforward red youll ever see it gave chelsea a crucial advantage and it was one they took advantage of in a very professional manner

tennis-198#moya emotional at davis cup win carlos moya described spains davis cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat andy roddick to end the usas challenge in seville moya made up for missing spains 2000 victory through injury by beating roddick 62 76 71 76 75 to give the hosts an unassailable 31 lead i have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day said moya all my energy has been focused on today what i have lived today i do not think i will live again spains only other davis cup title came two years ago in valencia when they beat australia and moya nicknamed charly admitted the davis cup is my dream and i was a bit nervous at the outset some people have said that i am obsessed but i think that it is better this way it helps me reach my goals if i am obsessed its really incredible to get the winning point is really something spanish captain jordi arrese said charly played a great game it was his opportunity and he hasnt let us down he had lost three times to roddick and this was his day to beat him he had been waiting years to be in this position spains victory was also remarkable for the performance of rafael nadal who beat roddick in the opening singles aged 18 years and 185 days the mallorcan became the youngest player to win the davis cup what a great way to finish the year said nadal afterwards us coach patrick mcenroe wants roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface i think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better obviously its unrealistic to say that were going to just start playing constantly on clay with the schedule but certainly i think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff said mcenroe roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of sevilles olympic stadium its just tough because i felt like i was in it the whole time against one of the top three claycourters in the world said the american i had my chances and just didnt convert them the bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend they came out took care of business and they beat us its as simple as that
tennis-199#hewitt survives nalbandian epic home favourite lleyton hewitt came through a dramatic fiveset battle with argentine david nalbandian to reach the australian open semifinals hewitt looked to be cruising to victory after racing into a twoset lead but nalbandian broke his serve three times in both of the next two sets to set up a nailbiting decider hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the 17th game and served out to win 63 62 16 36 108 and set up a meeting with andy roddick the winner of that match will face either roger federer or marat safin in the final ninth seed nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match and there was no indication he would do so as hewitt dominated the first two sets the argentine had stoked up the temperature ahead of the match by saying hewitts exuberant oncourt celebrations were not very good for the sport and he had words with hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs the balance of power changed completely in the third set as hewitt allowed his level to dip and he doublefaulted twice as nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set but the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat he then produced a love service game to finish off the match in four hours and five minutes i just kept hanging in there it was always tough serving second in the fifth set said hewitt who had never reached the last four at his home grand slam i told myself to give everything and in the end it paid off once again its a long way from holding that trophy up there but im hanging in there only four guys left that can win and were the top four in the world its set up for a pretty good showdown in the semis and finals

football-205#no lack of christmas spirit its that time of year when footballers and managers brace themselves for what i think is the most important period of the entire season i was thinking to myself last week that the last time i had a christmas off was 39 years ago i have never been out of work at christmas as a player or manager since i was 17 when our youth team coach at chesterfield a chap called reg wright gave us christmans off but only because there were no games i think things have changed dramatically over the years in terms of discipline and looking after themselves players take a lot more responsibility these days in particular the older ones im talking about those 32 and over here theyve changed their whole outlook in order to continue playing at this level managers as well need to trust players more than we have in the past in my squad i havent got anyone i have to warn regarding excess and overeating which is a massive bonus over the years there have been some players in the squad who you would never know if they were going to turn up for training smelling of booze as per usual we will be training on christmas day prior to our boxing day trip to coventry but there are times when you can do too much over christmas having the players in for training and then leaving for the game ill try and strike a balance and after weve trained in the morning the players can go home for a few hours and well leave for coventry about 7pm i allow the players to have a prechristmas night out they came to me in november and asked if they could have a night out in leeds and i said no i also said no to manchester sheffield and nottingham and eventually let them go to dublin after we played at millwall i send a minder with them to look after them not because i dont trust them the problem is that nowadays footballers are big news and you never know when somebody is going to step out with a mobile phone and take pictures of them you have to trust your players to behave themselves but unfortunately you cant govern for other peoples behaviour there is always an idiot out there who wants to get himself a bit notoriety or his name in the local paper by picking a fight and taking a pop at a professional footballer i also know that last year one newspaper asked certain young ladies to find out when and where players were holding their christmas parties in the hope of getting embarrassing photos i tried to behave myself as a player and i remember when i was at scunthorpe going to bed at 10pm on new years eve as we had a game on new years day i missed all the festivities and seeing the new year in only to wake up the next morning to find there was two feet of snow on the ground we all love christmas though and i like to take my children william and amy to see the lights and take them to santas grotto but when youre in football you accept that christmas is not the same for you as for others in fact until somebody mentioned it to me the other day i never realised that its become the norm for me and others in football not to have a christmas holiday one of the nice things when i do retire will be not having to worry about the phone ringing over christmas youre always on tenterhooks on christmas day that somebody is injured or has had an accident playing with their kids but i would like to take this opportunity to wish everybody a happy christmas and a prosperous new year

cricket-249#cricket coach moves on after tsunami when the tsunami crashed onto the sri lankan coastline cricket coach stephen jones was in the middle of catching practice within minutes the entire playing area at the galle stadium was covered by water but jones and the boys of the harrow school team made it to safety just in time thousands were not so lucky and now almost a month later jones is still coming to terms with the experience but he must do so whilst concentrating on his next coaching assignment to prepare the south african team for the womens world cup starting in march jones admits his memory of events in galle is still a blur he told bbc sport we were about half an hour from starting our game and were warming up fortunately we were doing fielding drills right in front of the pavilion had we been doing them anywhere else on the field we would have been in trouble i remember the level of noise going up and a colleagues wife and daughter screamed at us to watch out i was told and this i dont remember that one of the locals came up to me and told me to get off the field it probably took only five minutes maybe 10 minutes for the water to get to about five metres deep the harrow party took refuge in a viewing area next to the changing rooms which proved high enough the boys were terrified we were all terrified but they were also amazingly calm said jones i thought afterwards that if one of them had panicked it might just have set off a domino effect and we could have been in trouble if it had happened at the beginning of the tour it might have been different but i think the fact that we had been around together as a team counted in our favour the team ethic of looking out for each other really came to the fore the 49yearold from cape town believes his perspective on life has changed but he is conscious of the significance of the womens world cup which south africa is hosting and the need to do his utmost to focus fully on helping a team which has not played international cricket for a year im aware of the fact that perhaps womens cricket here is a little bit more in its infancy than in other countries theres a little bit further to go this world cup is critical if its a success and gets the exposure i hope it does it can elevate womens cricket here to a brand new level he said perhaps im going to be a bit more relaxed about it than i might have been and see it in its bigger context see the bigger picture but its nice to achieve things as well and its important for the girls to make a good go of it and make it a special occasion

football-264#newcastle 21 bolton kieron dyer smashed home the winner to end boltons 10game unbeaten run lee bowyer put newcastle ahead when he fed stephen carr on the right flank then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross wanderers hit back through stelios giannakopoulos who ended a fluid passing move with a wellstruck volley but dyer had the last word in a game of few chances pouncing on a loose ball after alan shearers shot was blocked and firing into the top corner neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game with plenty of tackles flying in but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by bolton keeper jussi jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the firsthalf keeping out shearers low shot and dyers closerange header but that was the only goalmouth action of note and it was almost out of nothing that the magpies took the lead on 35 minutes bowyer found space with a neat turn on the halfway line and striding forward picked out carr to his right he then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met carrs cross with a downward header into the far corner bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well they were level within six minutes thanks to a smart finish from giannakopoulos jayjay okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after a neat exchange of passes involving kevin davies and gary speed the greek striker found the bottom corner with a firsttime strike the magpies were opened up again before halftime as davies set giannakopoulos in space and given had to block at his near post but the home side survived and they should have retaken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half fernando hierro cynically chopped down dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through but the veteran defender escaped with a booking as there were other defenders nearby and from the resultant freekick laurent robert curled the ball just wide bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the magpies their strategy seemed to be working until the 69th minute alan shearers snapshot was charged down and dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing jaaskelainen from six yards bolton boss sam allardyce i am bitterly disappointed with the result but i am probably more disappointed with the secondhalf performance in the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure and our goal matched theirs in quality i thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half we allowed them to heap too much pressure on us and in the end we cracked newcastle boss graeme souness we deserved the win we had a really good second half bolton are a difficult side to play you have to match them physically first but we did that and then we played some football we had a slow first 45 minutes when we looked a bit tired but we got going after that the scoreline flattered them and we could have had one or two more goals newcastle given carr boumsong bramble babayaro dyer faye bowyer robert jenas 77 ameobi shearer subs not used butt harper milner hughes goals bowyer 35 dyer 69 bolton jaaskelainen hunt fadiga 14 ngotty ben haim candela giannakopoulos okocha vaz te 77 hierro campo 64 speed gardner davies subs not used jaidi poole booked ben haim hierro goals giannakopoulos 41 att 50430 ref s dunn gloucestershire
football-265#parry firm over gerrard listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from 1900 gmt but parry speaking exclusively to bbc sport also admits gerrard who has been constantly linked with chelsea will have the final say on his future he told bbc five live steven is above money he is the future of liverpool it doesnt matter if its 30m 40m or 50m we will not accept offers but we are also realistic enough to know we cant keep steven against his will on the subject of liverpools finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from a similar role at the premier league there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield and he had a busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard on the subject of liverpools captain and prize asset parry revealed real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes he said they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid was the same steven is not for sale but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said i sincerely hope he will be steven knows my views he knows rafas views we have reaffirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him we crave success as much as he does we know hes ambitious and nobody can argue with that i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than hed like to do anything else we all want to see progress by next season hes not alone in that there are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a 30mplus bid in the summer but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen there have been a lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer we didnt had an offer last summer parry explained we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didnt want to sell him in reality it didnt go beyond that maybe there will be an offer in the summer maybe there wont our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven and he has enough respect for us to know that it is his decision that will be crucial you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will that just doesnt work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way weve decided to sell you is not on the agenda you can forget that parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpools new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in 2007 and he confessed arsenals 100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground complete with naming rights has given the anfield club serious food for thought he said i have to say historically it is something i have been against and i have been on record as saying that but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eyeopener i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasnt even been worth contemplating but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow thats interesting my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but parry countered i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it time will tell i think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship i think it would be remiss not to thats not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but i think it is clearly something we have to explore on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board he also accused liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained steve has never been used as a stalking horse theres no need and that is not the way we do business we had discussions with steve over the course of 2004 i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didnt happen quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it we are still evaluating it steves interest was taken very much on its own merits his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold the door isnt closed on anything we had a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year we have a common interest in making liverpool successful thats a dream we all share so as far as im concerned the door is not closed i would take 50m if we had no investment but if we did keep him as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really 50m for gerrard i dont care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrards quality through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think is the right thing to do critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term i am hoping he doesnt walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash 50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it i would however be happy with gerrards transfer for any fee over 35m parrys statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players upping the ante is another smart move by parry i would keep gerrard no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy clearly if he isnt then we would be foolish not to sell the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible nonchampions league football
football-266#tappingup row is so much hot air the big talking point of the week is the issue of making illegal approaches or tapping up a player as usual the issue is probably blown out of proportion but i dont think anyone in football will deny there is a problem with the rules as they apply to recruiting players i read somewhere at the weekend that they did a straw poll and questioned every player at a particular club as to how he got there just about every one said the first approach was through their agent or a third party or somebody involved with the club on that basis under the rules as they stand they all got there illegally thats the name of the game these days im afraid not that i have ever tapped a player up i wouldnt dream of it i know there is a school of thought that says the rules that apply in football just wouldnt be tolerated in the outside business world in business if you want to change jobs you can simply go and have a chat with another prospective employer but in football youre not allowed to do that football does have strange anomalies for example the game has a disciplinary procedure where there is no evidence but you can still find yourself in trouble its the sort of thing that wouldnt happen in a court of law compared to the outside world football does have some very restrictive practices and a lot of them have to be looked at but if you want to be part of it you have to adhere to the rules you try and do things the right way but its like buying a house if you do things properly and play by the rules youll find yourself gazumped but i dont think the tapping situation is as bad as people say a lot of it is hot air by its very nature the only people who would be approached are the top players who are in demand anyway i dont think you would find too many approaches being made to bad players the championship is building up to an exciting climax and in beating us 20 last week ipswich gave signs of what a good team they are i think a place in the top two is beyond our reach but any one of 11 teams could make the playoffs and there are still 15 games to go of course the playoffs are exciting for fans but theyre not great for the heartrates of managers i think ive been involved in five playoff finals now and they should really come with a government health warning ideally you wouldnt want to be involved in the playoffs and the way to do that is to finish in the top two but i think that is beyond us now weve got a decent runin were still trying to strengthen the squad and by the time the next league game comes round i would hope weve got somebody in but that brings me on to another matter and the fact that the next game is more than a week away because of international matches youre always concerned about your players getting injured and some clubs withdraw their players more than others i always try and let our players go out for international games it keeps them happy but the other thorny issue with internationals is that of wages i think that while players are on international duty their wages should be paid by their countries sometimes they can be away for a week or more but the clubs still have to find their wages even though the player is denied to them for that period of time of course if a player is injured while on international duty its the clubs who have to pay his wages while hes out of action and recovering i think the associations of the country involved should bear some share of the responsibility
football-267#parry relishes anfield challenge bbc sport reflects on the future for liverpool after our exclusive interview with chief executive rick parry chief executive parry is the man at the helm as liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history parry has to deliver a new 60000seat stadium in stanley park by 2007 amid claims of costs spiralling above 120m he is also searching for an investment package of a size and stature that will restore liverpool to their place at european footballs top table but it is a challenge that appears to sit easily with parry who has forged a reputation as one of footballs most respected administrators since his days at the fledgling premier league liverpool have not won the championship since 1990 a fact that causes deep discomfort inside anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of chelsea manchester united and arsenal throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain steven gerrard and you can see parry is a man with a lot on his plate but in the comfort of a conference room deep inside liverpools heartbeat the kop end parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead he only dodged one question when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting liverpool a polite smile deflected the inquiry but to his credit he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that liverpool still mean business by business he means becoming title challengers again and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to liverpool is parrys mission parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager rafael benitez and his enthusiasm for the spaniards personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold benitezs early work has given parry renewed optimism about the years ahead but it remains a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations this will not come as news to parry a lifelong liverpool supporter but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting captain gerrard is central to liverpools plans and parrys insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent as ever the player will have the final say and parry acknowledges that but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for liverpool and gerrard to flourish in terms of the search for new investment hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in march 2004 thailand prime minister thaksin shiniwatra came and went while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan steve morgan morgan had a succession of bids rejected having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium bbc sport understands morgan is still ready and willing to invest in liverpool and parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere morgan however has had no formal contact with liverpool or their advisors since last december blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his 70m offer he was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others so any new approach would now have to come from liverpool morgan will certainly not be making another call so speculation continues about the new benefactor with trails leading to the middle east and america but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from anfield parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to liverpools future but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea he is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future liverpool management hostages to the new stadium parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up but there has been a vital new development in north london that has reshaped liverpools thinking liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights but the realism of arsenals stunning 100m deal for their new emirates stadium at ashburton has changed the landscape parry labelled the deal an eyeopener and admits liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities he knows some traditionalist liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just anfield but the maths of modernday football decree that multimillions for stadium and team could ease the pain i would take 50m if we had no investment but if we did keep him as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really 50m for gerrard i dont care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrards quality through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i

football-271#taking the highs with the lows i thought we gave a tremendous performance against arsenal last week and i have to say that anyone who saw our disallowed goal must realise there is no way it should ever have been ruled out it was interesting to hear the tv pundits ask if it was disallowed because dennis bergkamp had been sent off moments before i was surprised by the number of people who questioned whether the referee was trying to level things out the major decision which defeated me really was the caution given to cesc fabregas for his tackle on nick montgomery to me that should have been a straight red card yet all i saw in the papers were accusations that danny cullip allegedly stamped on fabregas but when i watch it back i dont see anything wrong there at all as ive said in the past you dont seem to get the rub of the green when youre a lower league club in these competitions but we have to go into the replay without any fear and thats what will happen come tuesday the only thing we can learn from arsenals champions league defeat against bayern munich is that we were even worse in our loss at plymouth we got beaten 30 and never looked like scoring at least arsenal got a goal and have a chance of winning at home in the second leg and theyve done that in the past whether theyll now want to risk their big stars on tuesday against us knowing they need to beat bayern 20 a week later is debatable unfortunately we have not got a squad big enough to be able to rotate and were very thin on the ground for the replay it looks like well be missing three or four of our better players we dont know if goalkeeper paddy kenny will be okay after being carried off against plymouth and cullip will be suspended however although the cup is diverting our attention the chances are we wont win it so the league has to be our priority an even more important match than the one against arsenal comes on saturday when we have to beat the championships bottom club rotherham and i will be reiterating to my players that we have 14 games left in the league and we have to start winning if we want to be in the playoffs weve lost four in a row in the league now but we havent got time to feel sorry for ourselves

football-299#time to get tough on friendlies for an international manager a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the 90 minutes at the end i would say its 5050 whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say youre better not doing so it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing the more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarterfinals against brazil often in friendlies though a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half and its very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes let alone a whole teams worth the debate will rage on and im not sure there is a satisfactory solution one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts it is the sort of move you would expect from walter who is a canny manager the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever john toshack has his first game in charge of wales and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results its extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies if you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you englands game against holland is a good example it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson but you have got to remember svengoran erikssons side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress for the club managers it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed
rugby-300#paris promise raises welsh hopes has there been a better six nations match than saturdays epic in paris and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since 1978 those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris welsh legend mervyn davies a member of two of three grand slamwinning sides of the 1970s hailed it as one of the great performances of the past three decades martyn williams wales twotry scorer on the day called it one of the most surreal games i have ever played in a crestfallen france coach bernard laporte simply observed there was a french half and there was a welsh half and what a half it was for the red dragonhood transforming a 156 halftime deficit into an 1815 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period but while that passage of play showed the swelling selfbelief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this welsh side that they recovered from a battering in the first halfhour to first stem the tide before halftime then reverse it on the resumption was remarkable enough but in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in a nailbiting final five minutes wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve in international rugby any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis england suffered some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light but the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline ten of the 22 on duty on saturday were also involved when wales were trounced 335 in paris two years ago but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the 2003 world cup wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class noted coach mike ruddock the likes of michael owen gethin jenkins dwayne peel and gavin henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summers lions tour to new zealand and players like stephen jones martyn williams shane williams and gareth thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve jones after his superb manofthematch display observed that we are a very happy camp now ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad the joie de vivre so evident in that magical secondhalf spell in paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s if england had half the innate attacking exuberance wales have produced in this championship they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats similarly wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches and that forward power mental toughness and good decisionmaking under pressure are equally important so on to murrayfield where wales have not won on their last three visits while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive the players will set about the task of beating scotland only then with the visit of ireland to finish can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s and writing their own names into welsh legend
football-301#linesman defends disallowed goal linesman rob lewis has defended his role in tottenhams disallowed goal against manchester united pedro mendes shot clearly crossed the line and lewis has been criticised for his positioning in the incident lewis said the spurs player shot from distance and i was doing my primary job which was to stand in line with the last defender and watch for an offside there was nothing i could have done differently apart from run faster than linford christie he added when the ball landed i was still 25 yards from goal and it was impossible to judge if it had crossed the line tottenham boss martin jol criticised the decision which cost his side three points the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why cant we just stop the game and get the decision right said jol after the 00 draw but at the end of the day its so obvious that pedros shot was over the line its incredible we feel robbed but its difficult for the linesman and referee to see it mendes shot from 50 yards and united goalkeeper roy carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear jol added we are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line it was a metre inside the goal what really annoys me is that we are here in 2005 watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isnt told about it we didnt play particularly well but i am pleased even now with a point although we should have had three mendes could not believe the goal was not given after seeing a replay he said my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate it was a very nice goal it was clearly over the line ive never seen one so over the line and not given in my career its really really over what can you do but laugh about it its a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didnt count its not every game you score from the halfway line manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology i think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and thats that technology should play a part in the game ferguson told mutv what i was against originally was the time factor in video replays but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee cant make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a freekick or take a corner or a goalkick so you wouldnt be wasting a lot of time i think you could start off by using it for goalline decisions i think that would be an opening into a new area of football arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford that just reinforces what i feel there should be video evidence said wenger its a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal

football-303#benitez joy as reds take control liverpool boss rafael benitez was satisfied after his teams 31 win over bayer leverkusen despite conceding a goal in the last minute before the game if you had said the score will be 31 i would have happily accepted that said benitez but you must realise that you have to concentrate right to the very last seconds of a game at this level i have confidence that we can complete the task in germany i am always confident and we must be positive benitez defended goalkeeper jerzy dudek whose failure to hold on to dimitar berbatovs weak drive allowed franca to score with the last kick of the game and give the german team a lifeline for the second leg for me it was not jerzy dudeks fault added benitez he had played a very good game and had we scored our other chances nobody would be talking about about their goal it would not have mattered if we had scored our other chances it would not have been worth remembering that last goal in my opinion jerzy played well made two very fine saves and i am happy with him if we lose 20 we are out but i think we can score in germany certainly one and that will make all the difference and the liverpool boss is looking forward to having skipper steven gerrard who was suspended for the anfield leg back for the return in germany steven gerrard is a key player for us said benitez when he is on the pitch he makes everyone else play better and the opposition pay special attention to him which gives space for others steven is one of the best players in the world but i need a team that is not about just one player there must be 11 players on the pitch all doing well

football-316#pennant guilty of wasting talent had jermaine pennant fulfilled the enormous potential that convinced arsenal to pay notts county 2m for the 16yearold in january 1999 his fall from grace might have registered more than a blip on footballs richter scale but the nottinghamborn winger has repeatedly failed to grasp the opportunities presented to him by the gunners so much so that it is inevitable the club will release him when his contract expires in the summer pennant effectively blew his chances of ever making it at highbury by upsetting the clubs normally unflappable manager arsene wenger who finally lost patience with the players poor timekeeping now after being caught drinkdriving for the second time in 12 months pennant no longer has to worry about whether he makes it to training on schedule aged 22 there is no doubt pennant still has time to resurrect his career when he is freed this summer compare his fate with that of west bromwich albion striker lee hughes who will be 34 by the time he has served his sixyear sentence for causing death by dangerous driving pennant may even find himself back at birmingham city the club who handed him a lifeline when it became clear his arsenal career was well and truly over blues manager steve bruce apparently saw enough in pennant in the month he was at st andrews to issue an empassioned plea for leniency ahead of sentencing claiming he had finally turned the corner weve got him in a flat up here weve got him away from the distractions of london weve had someone with him for the best part of every day and done everything we can to try and put him on the straight and narrow bruce said ahead of tuesdays court hearing hes done wrong and weve all done stupid things when we were younger and he admits that now you cant describe how stupid he has been but as long as he learns from it i dont think there is going to be any benefit from sending him to prison the judge apparently disagreed birmingham chairman david gold said last month he would still be keen to sign pennant even if the 22yearold got a custodial sentence but wherever pennant ends up talk will not be of his potential but whether he can steer clear of trouble off the pitch pennant has insisted in the past that he does not have an attitude problem but this is a player who as well as failing to turn up to training on time has been caught driving under the influence of alcohol twice sent home by england after breaking a team curfew before a euro under21 qualifier against turkey in april 2003 and been sent off in an u21 friendly against croatia in august of the same year for punching an opponent although he claimed he was racially abused pennants supporters may claim that too much fame and money at an early age are in some way to blame for his lapses in judgment during his sentencing his lawyer barry warburton told the court pennant had never been in trouble during a difficult childhood in nottingham despite growing up on one of the worst estates in the city he had only intermittent schooling and when he arrived at arsenal had very little reading and writing skills they in fact educated him said mr warburton who had claimed imprisonment could completely destroy his career but his childhood aside pennant knows he has been treading a fine line for some time he has publicly stated on numerous occasions that he is grateful to wenger and arsenal for their faith in him yet he continues to spurn the chances that are given him it all looked so good for pennant when he scored a 10minute hattrick against southampton on his full league debut for arsenal in may 2003 yet his wayward behaviour coupled with his inability to displace robert pires from the gunners first team mean he is a talent quickly disappearing over the footballing horizon whether he vanishes completely is down to him as professional footballers association chief executive gordon taylor puts it pennant is now at a crossroads in his career i hope he has got the strength to come out of this and be better for it said taylor

rugby-355#ireland win eclipses refereeing errors the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go bellyup it may have to go the whole way and have nflstyle video cameras all over the field or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself sundays explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since 1948 the game was as exciting as it comes with a muchimproved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way one can understand that frustration there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their 1913 victory but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sports blazers referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made after all he has no public recourse to criticism it was the same for simon mcdowell the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france as far as england were concerned there were queries over mark cuetos first halfeffort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup on that occasion david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control however one has to credit ireland flanker johnny oconnor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown but in rugby everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes the referee also missed englands danny grewcock taking out ronan ogara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line those were the standout moments in a classic game between the two old foes but there were many more and one should not take away from those brian odriscolls winning try was as wellconceived as they come while charlie hodgsons brilliant kicking display was another highlight and ronan ogaras tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on the first was denis hickies brilliant double tackle in the righthand corner he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson crossfield kick then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try irelands secondrow colossus paul oconnell was equally superb england had turned ireland one way then the other and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers unfortunately he ran into oconnell who hit him hard very hard and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover that spoke volumes about irelands backfoot display with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward it may be tries that win games but it is defence that wins championships

rugby-419#williams says he will never quit defiant matt williams says he will not quit as scotland coach even if his side slump to a new low with defeat by italy at murrayfield that would leave the scots as favourites to win the wooden spoon for the second year running i have never quit anything in my life apart from maybe painting the kitchen he told bbc sport the support we have been given from murrayfield in my whole time here has been 100 williams has yet to experience an rbs six nations victory after seven attempts and scotland have lost 12 of their 14 games under his leadership but he rejected the comparison made in some media sources with berti vogts recently sacked as scotland football manager after a poor run of results how can a german football coach and an australian rugby coach have anything in common he asked it is a bizarre analogy it is so absurd that it borders on the humorous williams insists that he is revelling in the pressure despite the possibility of a second six nations series without a victory that is not beyond the realms of possibility he admitted theres nothing much between the teams so we could win the next three games or lose them but i actually really enjoy seeing how you cope with such pressure as a coach it helps the team grow and helps you grow as a coach we could have won in paris but for the last five minutes and now we have two defeats but we were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat italy too
rugby-420#williams stays on despite dispute matt williams insists he has no thoughts of quitting as national coach as a result of the power struggle currently gripping scottish rugby the chairman chief executive and three nonexecutive directors all departed in a row over the games future direction but williams said i want to make it clear that im committed totally to scottish rugby ive brought my family here and weve immersed ourselves in scottish life theres no way that im walking away however he attempted to steer clear of taking sides in the dispute id like to stress that the national team is separate to the political situation he said when you come to an undertaking like this and you are trying to make a difference then there are always people who will begrudge you who are jealous and want to try to drag you down when you have that situation you have to have the courage of your convictions to see it through there was some very unhelpful and uninformed comment that the national team had received a massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of scottish rugby and that is simply not the case like all good coaches you go and ask for an increase but we were told in no uncertain terms that the financial situation did not allow that the idea that we are lighting cigars with 20 notes while the rest of scottish rugby flounders is absolutely untrue we also attracted criticism because of the number of days players spent with the national team but let me give you the truth our irish counterparts whom we have to compete with in a few days time had 70 days together at the summer they are currently in camp now and they will have another 21 days in camp before the six nations that means they will have 91 days away from their club from july until the six nations we on the other hand will have 16 there must be a winwin philosophy and attitude within scottish rugby and that is what we are after both groups winning not competing

rugby-428#all black magic new zealand rugby playing colours all black the haka and more the all blacks charles john munro discovered rugby at londons christ college and on his return to nelson he staged new zealands first game nelson town met nelson college on 14 may 1870 the town triumphing by two goals to nil instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the countrys sporting passions the game appealed to the kiwi psyche and quickly spread the native maoris finding a particular empathy with the sports warrior ethos in 1888 a british team led by ae stoddart toured new zealand and australia and soon after a maori named joe warbrick and an english expat called thomas eyton decided to gather a combined new zealand team twentytwo maori and four pakiha formed the new zealand native team who played a total of 107 matches in new zealand australia and the uk the integration of white and maori was a reflecion of enlightened new zealand rugby and society even if the british press were somewhat mystified by the prematch tradition of the maori war dance the haka the other great symbol of new zealand rugby the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast was proposed by tom ellison at the first annual meeting of the new zealand rugby football union in 1893 new zealand played their first international against australia in 1903 the kiwis triumphing 223 in sydney and the following year an official british touring team came to new zealand for the first time the tourists had gone through australia undefeated but their captain david revell bedellsivright created animosity in new zealand with his patronising attitude the kiwis shocked the rugby world with a 93 triumph in wellington sparking great celebrations across the country but bedellsivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the uk their opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official new zealand tour to europe the tourists won their early games with a quickthinking inventive approach but press criticism began to grow over their 232 scrum formation that left a roving forward free to disrupt opposition attacks the tactic was effective two late tries seeing the kiwis to a 127 win over scotland before ireland were despatched 150 in dublin a huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a 150 hammering of england new zealand headed to wales to meet a country in the midst of its first golden age and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed a 30 win in a hardfought encounter at cardiff arms park but postmatch talk was dominated by a bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas dallas said that deans was tackled short but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try on his deathbed three years later he exclaimed i did score that try in cardiff four of the 1905 all blacks went over to the newly formed all golds rugby league side soon after the tour but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglowelsh touring team in 1908 the first south africa tour of new zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a threetest series starting the greatest rivalry in rugby and the longrunning controversy between the countries over the all blacks inclusion of maori players the awesome 19245 all black tourists became known as the invincibles after winning all 30 of their games in france britain and ireland including a crushing 190 victory over wales at st helens despite their success the all blacks 232 scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in 1928 employing the modern 341 scrum lineup against the new zealand rover system for the first time south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn twoall the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the 1930 lions tour a series won 31 by new zealand the lions manager describing the tactic as cheating prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum the all blacks 1935 european tour started inauspiciously with an 113 loss to a swansea side inspired by teenage schoolboy halfbacks hayden tanner and willie davies a thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales 1312 although the winning try from geoffrey reesjones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the buildup new zealands next visit to wales in 1953 proved difficult as they lost 83 to cardiff and drew 66 at swansea the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park but the teams were locked at 88 when a clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for a famous matchwinning try the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations before a 195 success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller new zealand built from that tour and by the time they returned in 19634 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world that made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely 30 win over the tourists at rodney parade wilson whinnerays side rallied to beat wales 60 their first win at the arms park in four attempts and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour but when they returned home the first question put to them was what happened in newport the only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with east wales as they beat the full wales team 136 in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in 1969 the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team a ferocious game at the arms park in 1972 was edged 1916 by the all blacks a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn jamesinspired lions of 1971 james guided llanelli to a famous 93 win over the tourists at stradey park though and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks 2311 in cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played new zealand defeated a wales xv 123 at the arms park in a noncap game in 1974 but it was the 1978 game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries wales were leading 1210 with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from a lineout television pictures clearly showed that he dived but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty duly converted by brian mckechnie for a 1312 win since that infamous game the competition has largely left wales v new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game a crushing 233 win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby unions 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside 496 in brisbane in the semifinal of the inaugural world cup the kiwis went on to claim the cup and would inflict further misery on wales on their illfated 1988 tour of new zealand a young talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them 523 and 549 after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game but as his views were ignored he along with a generation of wales best players chose to head north to rugby league a 349 win in cardiff followed for new zealand in 1989 and at the 1995 world cup wales big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg a crushing 427 kiwi triumph in wembley followed in 1997 and as wales misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen there was a temporary resurgence in the welsh game but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiffs new millennium stadium in 2002 they left with a 4317 victory a bruising 553 defeat followed for wales in hamilton in 2003 as hansen built towards the world cup but in australia it was a remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope wales were given no chance going into the game but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead 3733 early in the second half new zealand rallied to a 5337 win but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen coming to europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season an encouraging display against south africa has inspired a confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years they have a chance but clearly history is not on their side

football-444#2004 a year to remember club football in south america continues to suffer from the continents economic crisis the best players are lured across the atlantic 900 players left brazil alone in 2004 and crowds are low with money tight and the fear of violence proving a powerful incentive to stay at home the average attendance in this years brazilian championship was a record low of 8139 furthermore in 2004 no new talent exploded on the continent with quite the same force as diego robinho and carlos tevez in the two previous years there is no doubt that the highlight of south americas footballing year has to come from the international game there were some dramatic tournaments in 2004 the copa america held in peru last july could hardly have come to a more exciting conclusion with the last kick of the final brazil scored one of the most decisive equalising goals in the history of football argentina thought they had the game won and were in no state to take penalties when adrianos 93rdminute blast forced a shootout earlier in the year there was intense disappointment for brazil when they amazingly failed to qualify for the olympic football tournament the gold medal is the only title they lack but they will have to wait four more years after missing out on the two qualification slots up for grabs in south americas under23 championships held in chile in january argentina and paraguay made it through and went on to secure gold and silver in athens these tournaments were terrific but the real highlights of the year in south american football could only come from the world cup qualification campaign the reason it is the only time that all the great players come back home and play competitive matches in front of their own fans i well remember getting a shiver down my spine awaiting the kickoff of the match between brazil and argentina at the start of june euro 2004 was about to get under way the thought struck me that the accumulation of talent on the belo horizonte pitch was at least as outstanding as that about to go into action in portugal for 90 minutes brazil was the capital of the football world ronaldo obviously felt the sense of occasion he will probably never play a bigger match in brazil and it was taking place in the stadium where he had made his name over a decade earlier he was unstoppable suffering and scoring three penalties in brazils 31 win if ronaldos performance was the individual highlight of the year my collective prize goes to argentina in a match they played a few months later in october i was down in buenos aires to see their first match under new coach jose pekerman nerves were settled with an early goal and old rivals uruguay were blasted away soon after halftime argentina were four up and although uruguay hit back with two consolation goals it was the performance of the hosts that lingers in the memory argentinas goals were magnificent team efforts involving all of the fundamentals of wellplayed football the ball moved quickly around the field with plenty of running off the ball to provide options and lots of crisp accurate passing mixing long and short to find gaps in the defence the crowd responded in fine style creating the kind of atmosphere familiar to all those old enough to remember the 1978 world cup these then were my highlights of 2004 with seven vital rounds of world cup qualifiers scheduled for next year south american football should come up with much more to celebrate in 2005

cricket-455#england victory tainted by history as england attempt to secure a series victory in south africa they will do so at the venue for a previous match which became the stuff of test cricket folklore south africas meeting with england at centurion park in january 2000 was thought to have been an enthralling spectacle with the tourists claiming a remarkable win after three whole days were lost to bad weather it took a few short months to reveal the unfortunate truth that a bookmaker had given home skipper hansie cronje money and a leather jacket to influence the outcome of the match cronje who was killed two years later in a plane crash was subsequently found guilty of matchfixing and banned from test cricket for life opening the bowling for england was andy caddick who told bbc sport they were 20 up in the series we had a lot of english supporters there and south africa just wanted to make a game of it thats what i thought at the time you dont think anything of it but then afterwards you start to put two and two together with events that happened afterwards england captain nasser hussain put the south africans in after winning the toss and was given an early reward of a purely cricketing nature when gary kirsten edged darren gough to second slip for a duck in the first over cronje also fell to gough for a duck as the home side closed the first day 1556 the next three days were then wiped out competely due to a combination of rain and damp ground conditions before cronje approached hussain with a suggestion to manufacture a result south africa had already secured the series having won in johannesburg and cape town but cronje and his friends wanted to create some interest in the final day at centurion the idea was for each side to forfeit an innings each leaving the tourists with a run chase so south africa reached 2488 on the final morning to set england 249 from 76 overs kirsten was one of several players opposed to the move as he explained to bbc sport hansie came up to us in the changing room on the last day and said im keen to forfeit the innings and set the total he asked the team and there was a mixed reception some of the guys felt we didnt want to give england a chance of winning you dont mess around with test matches and some said nothing hansie just decided and maybe we know why in hindsight to go for it but there was quite a bit of resistance and some of the guys didnt think it was a good idea at all englands 12th man that day was phil tufnell who recalled everyone thought it was a very good gesture in the spirit of the game the game had meandered along and all of a sudden it was like an old fashioned threeday county game and we were having a chase whatever the reasons later it emerged that cronjes part had been simply to ensure against a draw it led to a fascinating cricket match england needed six from the final seven balls and yorkshire tailenders chris silverwood and darren gough both hit boundaries to give them a twowicket victory it ended as a great day for cricket kirsten conceded one could argue it was good for people who had been frustrated having not watched any cricket and suddenly got a great last day but from a players point of view youve worked so hard for three months trying to win a test series that you dont give test matches away or create the opportunity to make it easy to win one tufnell has favourable memories of cronje who played county cricket for leicestershire in the 1990s he always came across as a nice bloke the spinner said he always came and said hi and seemed a very intelligent captain a good competitor and a good ambassador for south african cricket kirsten too recalls some positive images of cronje we all know that what he did cannot be condoned in any circumstances he said but my view is he did a huge amount for my career i thought he was an outstanding captain and ive made mistakes in my life so im not in a position to be judgemental

spain lead 10 after carlos moya beat mardy fish in straight sets in the opening match of the tie nadal holds his nerve and the crowd goes wild as spain go 20 up in the tie roddick holds serve to force nadal to serve for the match but the american surely cannot turn things around now nadal works roddick around the court on two consecutive points to earn two break points one is enough the spaniard secures the doublebreak and roddick is now teetering on the edge roddick is trying to gee himself up but the clay surface is taking its toll on his game and he is looking tired nadal wins the game to love nadal steps up the pressure to break and spain have the early initiative in the fourth set nadal also holds convincingly as both players feel their way into the fourth set roddick shrugs off the disappointment of losing the thirdset tiebreak and breezes through his first service game of the fourth set nadal earns the first minibreak in the tiebreak as the match enters its fourth hour a couple of stunning points follow one where nadal chases down a roddick shot and turns into a passing winner then roddick produces some amazing defence at the net to take the score to 44 roddick has two serves for the set but doublefaults to take the score to 55 nadal saves a roddick set point then earns his own with a drive volley and a crosscourt passing winner sends the crowd wild nadal tries to up his aggression and he passes roddick down the line to go 1540 and two set points up roddick saves the first with a desperate lunge volley and smacks a volley winner across the court to take the score back to deuce before securing the game the set will go to another tiebreak nadal enjoys another straightforward hold and roddick must once again serve to stay in the set roddick again holds on despite some brilliant shotmaking from his opponent nadal races through his service game to put the pressure straight back onto roddick roddick hangs in on his serve to level matters but nadal is making him fight for every point nadal could be suffering a disappointment hangover from the previous game as he goes 030 down and then has to save a break point after a tremendous rally in which he is forced into some brilliant defence but it pays off and the spaniard edges ahead in the set roddicks serve is not firing as ferociously as usual and has to rely on his sheer competitive determination to stay in the set three times nadal forces a break point and three times the world number two hangs in and roddicks grit pays off as he manages to hold roddick still looks a bit sluggish but he attacks the net and is rewarded with a break point which nadal saves with a good first serve and the spaniard goes on to hold there is a disruption in play as roddick is upset about something in the crowd the spanish captain gets involved as does the match referee but it is unclear what the problem is one thing for certain is that the crowd are roused into support of nadal and they go wild when roddick loses the next point and goes break point down roddick saves the break point and then bangs down his ninth ace before clinching the game with a service winner the game passes the twohour mark as nadal holds serve to edge ahead in the third set now roddick has to defend a break point and he produces a characteristic ace to save it it is immediately followed by another and he holds with a little dinked halfvolley winner roddick is looking a little leadenfooted but does carve out a break point for himself but he plays it poorly and nadal avoids the danger roddick has gone off the boil and again struggles he fails to get down properly for a low forehand volley and gives nadal three break points the american blasts an ace to save one but follows up with a double fault and the rubber is level nadal edges towards taking the second set with a comfortable hold two good serves put roddick 300 up but he then makes a couple of errors to find himself 3040 down he saves the break point with an ace and then manages to hold roddicks level has dropped while nadal is on a hot streak the spaniard includes a superb crosscourt winner off the back foot as he races through his service game without dropping a point roddick doublefaults twice and nadal takes full advantage of the break point offered powering a passing winner past roddick nadal wins another tight game neither player has dipped from the high standard of play in the first set nadal puts the american under pressure and roddick saves a break point with a superb stop volley before going on to hold nadal puts the disappointment of losing the firstset tiebreak to claim the opening game in the second roddick doublefaults to concede the first minibreak and then nadal loops a crosscourt winner to seize advantage in the tiebreak he lets one slip but wins his next serve to earn three set points but roddick saves them and then earns one himself nadal comes up with a downtheline winner but then nets tamely on roddicks next set point nadals nerve is tested as he tries to force a tiebreak both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide a pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any easy points the point of the match so far involves roddicks slamdunk smash being returned by nadal before roddick finally manages to end the rally on the very next point nadal blasts a forehand service return from right of court that passes roddick and even the american is forced to applaud but roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game nadal outplays roddick to reach 400 but the american fights back to 4030 before nadals powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game the crowd are getting very involved cheering between roddicks first and second serves but the american comes through to hold and edge ahead in the set nadal manages to hold again despite roddick piling the pressure on his serve the spaniard wins the game courtesy of another lucky net cord roddick double faults buts manages to keep his composure a wellplaced serve is unreturnable and roddick holds a powerful ace down the middle gives nadal a simple love service game the first time he has held serve so far in the match if roddick didnt know before he knows now that he is in a real contest another superb game as nadal breaks to once again lift the roof he produces some fine groundstrokes to leave roddick chasing shadows four of the first five games have seen a break of serve despite the disappointment of losing his serve roddick is not phased and storms into a 4015 lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm a close linecall nadal takes the next point but roddick breaks again with a sharp volley at the net roddicks advantage is short lived as nadal breaks back immediately a fortunate net cord helps the spaniard on his way and when roddick fires a forehand cross court shot wide to lose his serve nadal pumps his fist in celebration the american is pumped up for this clash and takes on nadals serve from the start nadals drop shot is agonisingly called out and roddick claims the vital first break after moyas win in the opening rubber a raucous seville crowd is buoyed by nadals impressive start which sees him race into a 300 lead however roddick fights back to hold his serve

rugby-489#murphy that was a bruising battle thats what i call a tough game it was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victory their organisation was very very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by it is by far the strongest italian team that we have faced we knew all along that we would be a huge threat particularly the first game in the championship it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early we had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually it was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it im not too bad but there are one or two others who will be feeling it a bit on monday morning in the backs we were not frustrated at such but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical the different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficult but we managed to get the ball in our hands and i got a try near the end of the first half its always good to score it was great work by brian and i always knew i had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee eddie osullivan was very calm at halftime even though we were only 86 ahead he spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory that new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half we were penalised a lot at the breakdown and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break so really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon as yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries but it does not that good now we have to focus on scotland and only six days to recover its a big ask after such a bruising encounter i was very impressed the way the scots played against the french on saturday it could so easily have gone their way but for a couple of decisions we will be under no illusions it is going to be tough for us in the meantime when in rome

football-534#gerrard future not decided by cardiff loss steven gerrards own goal in liverpools carling cup defeat against chelsea sparked yet another round of speculation about his anfield future there was no denying the irony of gerrards mishap coming as it did in a cup final against the club that almost paid 30m for him last summer and that irony was not missed by the media or indeed chelseas supporters but to suggest the incident and the defeat will shape whether he stays or goes from liverpool is wrong it was just one of those things that could have happened anywhere at any time in any place and in any game it wasnt even a mistake although you could say the mistake was in three liverpool defenders going for the same ball but to pull together a subplot or conspiracy theory that the own goal combined with liverpools defeat has finally put gerrard on the road to stamford bridge is nonsense it was inevitable that because it came against chelsea there would be speculation but i believe gerrard will be concentrating on one thing and one thing alone and that is ensuring liverpool qualify for the champions league by getting that fourth place in the premiership i dont think any decision has been made and will certainly not be influenced by anything that happened in cardiff on sunday liverpool must hope they clinch fourth place and that is enough to persuade their massively influential captain to stay from liverpools point of view the defeat was a bitter disappointment but when the disappointment has subsided they can take heart from a week of encouragement both at home and abroad liverpool had an excellent win against bayer leverkusen in the champions league when they got it down played and scored goals and in sundays carling cup final they showed real defensive resilience when they were pinned back for long periods i think rafael benitez is on the right lines and speaks with a lot of confidence about his team and what he wants from them but there is no doubt liverpools next two games will shape their season at newcastle away in the league and then bayer away in the champions league second leg what they cannot afford to do is produce any performances like they produced at burnley southampton or birmingham if they slip up at newcastle then everton beat blackburn 24 hours later that will be an 11point gap and thats an awful long way back for them in the race for the champions league place there is added spice because everton are fourth they had an impressive win at aston villa and you cannot take away from them what they have done theyve had an uncertain spell recently but theyve picked up points here and there and that is a great tribute to manager david moyes and his players and in tim cahill theyve paid 2m for a player from outside the premiership who has proved himself in the topflight liverpool will still be a massive magnet for top players but they may also need to seek out the type of signings that moyes has pulled off with cahill he has been excellent since arriving from millwall and has been a very sound purchase by moyes while the battle for fourth hots up manchester united turned the screw a little tighter on leaders chelsea by beating portsmouth and reducing the gap to six points albeit with a game in hand for jose mourinhos side the carling cup win against liverpool was massive for chelsea because it stopped all the inevitable questions that would have been posed if they had lost three games in a week i dont think they answered all the questions because for all their long periods of possession they were struggling to score until gerrards unfortunate intervention obviously a lot of focus has been centred on mourinho for events on and off the pitch but i think he will be more than happy with that because it means the heat is taken off his players if people are asking questions about the manager they are leaving the players in peace so mourinho will settle for that and while united are showing once again there is noone better when it comes to the chase i dont think there is any shift in the balance of power in the premiership it is all chelseas to lose with a sixpoint lead and a game in hand throw in that their next four league games are against the bottom four sides in the table and you can see they are in a strong position they must keep their eye on the ball because manchester united are masters of this situation but the balance of power still lies with chelsea
cricket-535#england fail to finish job again england have done their best throughout this series to suggest that they are vulnerable and on a rainhit third day at centurion their batsmen did it again when michael vaughan horribly mispulled shaun pollock to square leg for a fourball duck england had lost three tame wickets for two runs in three overs they seemed to be doing their best to keep the game open when they should have been doing their utmost to close it down the first to go was marcus trescothick who was run out thanks to a misjudgement by andrew strauss trescothick at the nonstrikers end responded to strausss call when he drove makhaya ntini to straight mid off but strauss suddenly changed his mind and as trescothick tried desperately to regain his ground nicky boje swooped onehanded and threw the stumps down direct robert key fell three overs later when he was caught behind down the leg side for a single key glared at umpire bucknor when he raised his finger and dragged himself off the ground but replays suggested that he had indeed touched the ball four balls later vaughan was caught and england were reeling on 293 andrew strauss then appeared completely to lose touch and frankly graham thorpe has only very occasionally been in form throughout the series the lefthanders scratched about barely laying bat on ball but somehow they survived despite some very close lbw appeals they managed to add 85 between the interruptions until strauss uncharacteristically chased a ball well wide of his off stump from andre nel and edged to boucher for 44 moments later lightening drove the players from the ground time is ticking away now and with just two days to go it would take something remarkable for the south africans to win the match from here but englands fallibility and their growing tendency to allow the opposition a second chance is something that should concern their supporters everyone is anticipating a close exciting ashes series in the summer but being completely honest england will have to improve enormously on their efforts on this tour even to come close to threatening the aussies

football-546#gunners clock up winning record arsenal claimed the premiership title and rewrote the record books in the process by going the entire 38game season unbeaten it was the first time a team had gone through a topflight season undefeated since preston in the 188889 season arsenal romped home by a convincing 11point margin from chelsea the closest they came to defeat was in the socalled battle of old trafford when ruud van nistelrooy missed a lastminute penalty in a goalless draw it was a game that cast a shadow over the season with van nistelrooy surrounded by angry arsenal players arsenals lauren was banned for four games martin keown three matches and ray parlour one after the incident manchester united pair ryan giggs and cristiano ronaldo were also fined for their part in the fracas arsenals title triumph made up for more disappointment on the european stage where they lost to chelsea in the champions league quarterfinals arsene wengers side looked on course to finally end their champions league drought particularly after winning 51 away to inter milan but in a twist on their domestic domination chelsea won 21 at highbury to clinch a 32 aggregate victory manchester united fared even worse going out to porto when francisco costina scored a lastminute old trafford equaliser united finished third in the league but had an fa cup win for consolation portos success introduced manager jose mourinho to a wider audience and particularly chelsea chelsea manager claudio ranieri lived under a cloud of speculation all season particulary claims he would be replaced by svengoran eriksson it intensified when eriksson was caught holding talks with chelsea chief executive peter kenyon an embarrassed england coach was then awarded a new fouryear contract by the football association ranieri sealed his fate with a series of bizarre substitutions as chelsea lost 31 in the first leg of the champions league semifinal in monaco and when he inevitably lost his job it was mourinho who went on to win the champions league with porto who stepped in to take over mourinhos reign began well with chelsea topping the premiership at christmas and joining arsenal manchester united and liverpool in the next phase of the champions league another manager to lose his job was liverpools gerard houllier whose reign ended after six years houllier paid the price for finishing fourth and without a trophy last term he was replaced by valencias rafael benitez whose impressive credentials included winning spains la liga and the uefa cup last season valencia beat marseille 20 to cement benitezs growing reputation manchester united enjoyed their moment of glory by beating millwall 30 in the fa cup final in cardiff ruud van nistelrooy struck twice and cristiano ronaldo was also on target at dennis wises side were outclassed by their premiership opponents wolves lost their premiership status along with leicester city and leeds united who completed a stunning decline from grace leeds had reached the champions league semifinal three years before they went down after defeat at bolton the three were replaced by norwich west brom and crystal palace who beat west ham in the playoff in cardiff the summer saw bigspending in the transfer market with wayne rooney the central figure in the drama teenager rooney returned to everton after euro 2004 with superstar status assured after stunning performances and when he refused to sign a new fiveyear contract newcastle united opened the bidding at 20m a transfer request followed and manchester united completed a 27m deal just hours before the transfer window closed at the end of august rooney confirmed his worth with a hattrick on his debut in the champions league against fenerbahce chelsea inevitably were among the bigspenders again splashing out 24m on marseilles didier drogba and 20m on porto defender ricardo carvalho last and by no means least the other major piece of domestic silverware went to middlesbrough who ended 128 barren years by winning the carling cup they beat bolton 21 in the final with goals from josephdesire job and a penalty from boudewijn zenden the pressures of the topflight were cruelly illustrated at southampton paul sturrock was sacked only two games into the new season one of which was a win against blackburn and only 13 games in total at st marys another manager to pay the price earlyseason was west broms gary megson who was sacked after revealing he would not renew his contract he guided west brom back into the premiership but his relationship with chairman jeremy peace was fragile bryan robson succeeded him as he returned to his old club in scotland henrik larsson bid an emotional and successful farewell to celtic after seven glorious seasons celtic won the league and also the scottish cup beating dunfermline 31 in the final with the swede scoring twice to take his seasons tally to 41 and it took his overall celtic goals record to 242 goals in 315 appearances

football-554#a need to limit foreign numbers with all the top clubs vying for the title and the champions league at least the fa cup gave an opportunity for one or two of the younger lads at the major clubs to get a game in the first team i dont personally like to see weakened sides in the competition but it seems in some cases its the only chance for the young lads to get some firstteam experience over the years the influx of foreign players has affected the young englishman more than anyone i know you have to have freedom of movement but i do believe a time will come when countries will have to put a limit on the number of overseas players including europeans i think the trend has become more noticeable since the influx of foreign bosses like arsene wenger claudio ranieri and now jose mourinho they seem to know the foreign market more than the english although chelsea appear to be signing one or two young englishmen when the foreigners first started coming into the country i thought people like dennis bergkamp and gianfranco zola were absolutely magnificent zola is still the best player i have ever seen in my time as a manager i dont think anybody would ever begrudge players like that because you would pay money to watch these individuals but i think the problem now is that clubs even at the lower level find english players expensive agents are offering players left right and centre who are not only cheap but can also come over on trial which was unheard of in the past bolton are a good example i never thought they could be successful but sam allardyce has waved his magic wand and brought these players over the technology that sam uses has definitely paid off he has all these databases on every foreign player he is a unique person i never thought you could have 10 different nations in a dressing room and still have a good team spirit but sam has proved that wrong over the last few years and will continue to do it what bolton have said is they cant pay large transfer fees but they can get these players in for 612 months and compete at a high level that way my view about foreign players changed about three years ago when i had quite a large number of them at bramall lane the match we played with west brom which was abandoned after we went down to six players changed my views on having a large amount of foreign players i decided then to go with the kids and if i could sign english lads i would i got two sent off in that game and one or two other things happened with players i also found that with a couple of players that didnt talk english it is very difficult coachingwise to get them to grasp the fundamentals if possible i will look for players i sign to speak english although we are in the process of signing hao haidong from china he has very limited english but is a very experienced player who i dont think you have to tell too many times what you want him to do there was a time when scottish football was a good source for players but if you speak to people that look at players up there now it is clear the standard has dropped over the years you only have to look at the scotland squad the talent is not there any longer because they dont invest in their youth development it is common knowledge we enquired about liverpools neil mellor who could now find himself pushed down the pecking order by the arrival of fernando morientes from real madrid i think people like neil are better off getting some games under their belt but its difficult because liverpool are such a great club and he has had opportunities there he has scored goals there so they rate him highly and it must be difficult for young players to turn their back on that and drop down to the championship level

cricket-557#england need to regroup south africa duly levelled the series in midafternoon when englands unlikely top scorer steve harmison was caught in the gully for 42 england now have three days of relaxation in cape town in which to contemplate their first defeat in 14 matches before heading to johannesburg for the fourth test coach duncan fletchers main problem is that only a handful of players are currently pulling their weight of the bowlers matthew hoggard is plugging away manfully but he and andrew flintoff appear to be the only seam bowlers michael vaughan feels he can trust at present simon jones is bowling steadily enough yet vaughan seems to bring him on only as a last resort while harmison remains a shadow of the bowler who until this tour topped the world rankings spinner ashley giles was more consistent in cape town than in the previous test but rarely looked threatening the lack of application of the batsmen however has been the principle reason for england having lost their lead andrew strauss and marcus trescothick can be excused criticism but even they would admit that along with all the others their wickets have been given away far too easily what must really frustrate fletcher is that south africas bowling attack is little more than workmanlike and should not have dismissed england for 139 in their first innings in durban and 163 in the first innings here on a wearing pitch they still needed 124 overs to bowl england out a second time and the last wicket pair of harmison and hoggard were able to add 51 with little difficulty at least the news of andrew flintoffs injury is encouraging an mri scan revealed that his problem is an abdominal strain rather than intercostal had it been the latter it would have ended his tour at a stroke but the belief now is that with treatment he should be fit to bowl in johannesburg if the injury does not recover in time england face the nightmare of trying to choose a balanced team mark butchers prognosis does not appear to be as promising he is wearing a cast on his left wrist which will be removed next week but time seems to be running out for him neutral observers still believe that england are the better team but having avoided defeat in durban and scored a resounding victory here south africa now have the force with them

football-564#highbury will be our cup final arsenal is a very special place for me because it is one of the few away games i remember going to when i was a boy i cant remember what the year was but i was so young i was in short trousers my father worked for english steel corporation he was a crane driver and worked 12hour shifts every year they had a trip to london and in this particular year they were going to london to watch arsenal play i remember him smuggling me on to the bus then into the imperial hotel which i remember vividly and then smuggling me over the turnstiles at highbury i remember looking across at the massive clock which has gone now and it is a memory i will never forget it was a marvellous game the arsenal fans were absolutely brilliant and all the sheffield united fans mixed with them we lost 10 but our centrehalf joe shaw was for me the best player in the world that day on saturday my son who at threeandahalfyears is a similar age to what i was is going to be on the pitch before the game while my daughter is the mascot i think it will have the same effect on him i dont think you forget things like that i think the next time i went to highbury was when i took a team there when i was at notts county we went there in the top flight and lost 20 but i took huddersfield down there for the second leg of the league cup and got a draw i think they expected to get a cricket score because they beat us 50 in the first leg ian wright was in the team and george graham made one or two comments that made us pretty determined and had they not equalised late on we would have won that leg they are a club i admire a lot after we played arsenal in the semifinal in 2003 the number of letters and messages i got from arsenal fans regarding the behaviour of our fans and our team was quite outstanding and it just shows they are a great set of supporters everybody will be making an issue of that game at old trafford i felt personally hard done by you dont mind getting beat but in this particular case i think everybody saw their goal scored by freddie ljungberg was a travesty and should not have been allowed i got fined for comments i made about referee graham poll though i would not take any of those back but thats how it has gone for us the higher you go means you have to have premier league referees and we have never really done very well with them i would have liked a football league official but neale barry who is an experienced referee has been awarded the game and you have to get on with it that said i think we will need more than help from the referee on saturday after watching them demolish crystal palace on monday i turned it off after they scored three goals in about eight minutes and watched bambi with the kids since i have watched the premiership there have been a number of players who i think have been absolutely out of this world and would have paid anything to watch one was eric cantona and another was gianfranco zola who i thought was absolutely fantastic arsenal have two of those type of players i still cannot believe some of dennis bergkamps touches his movement footballing brain and awareness and at nearly 36 is incredible i dont think any adjective is good enough to describe thierry henry for me he is the rolls royce of arsenal and the premiership itself no doubt they will be thinking of resting a few players for their champions league game on tuesday but i am doing the same for our championship game with plymouth that is a far more important game for us arsenal is like our cup final i feel like we have already got to the final we have earned the money we set out to earn for the club and now we can enjoy our day out plymouth is the next big game for me and we have to be ready for that whatever team arsenal play it is going to be a hell of a difficult task to get anything we are just thinking about being respectable after looking at palace the other night i think you will probably get odds of 1001 for us to win and thats in a twohorse race people ask me if we have done anything different in our preparations this week we havenothing the players have been too exhausted after playing for almost an hour with 10 men on sunday that they have not been able to do anything they have done stretches and warm downs but very little football because of tiredness on thursday we will work on something but when it comes to dealing with bergkamp and henry i will probably say to my defenders just close your eyes and get your fingers crossed when they are on their game there is not much you can do about them

rugby-587#moore questions captaincy brian moore believes the england captain should not be a fullback jason robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the six nations tournament in the absence of flyhalf jonny wilkinson the world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain martin johnson a lock forward and former england captain moore told the bbc fullbacks are too far away from the action thats not a reflection on robinson personally he added i just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack which is after all where games usually start and finish moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales france and ireland in this years tournament assertiveness in the pack isnt there were not getting enough people into the breakdowns he explained were not getting quick ball which means the backs are being stifled their creativity depends on quick ball and were not getting that with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon a chance and moore believes the last two games against italy and scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury dont have the requisite experience moore added you cant do anything about that but play them there are players who have been knocking on the door its time for them to be looked at in these last two games because theres nothing on them we then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby

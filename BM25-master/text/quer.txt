football-43#mourinho plots impressive course chelseas win at fulham confirming their position at the premiership summit proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season they have got strength in depth great players an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match all they need to add now is the big prizes which as we all know is the most difficult part of all one thing is certain they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed they beat a very tough everton at stamford bridge won at newcastle in the carling cup and then won 41 at fulham which was a great result given that they had been showing good form as i said winning the major honours is the hardest task of all but in mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all the champions league and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players it is a priceless commodity noone can be anything other than highlyimpressed by mourinho he is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people and maybe he can appear that way but he has the silverware to back up the talk mourinho doesnt simply talk a good game hes won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto some may criticise his talk but the words are backed up with actions ive also found him to be very realistic whenever ive heard him hes spent a lot of money and it seems to be working and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked the buys are now integrating and in arjen robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension in the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics and yet he was winning games you cannot win titles early on in the season but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital i also thought the criticism was very harsh because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful now they are taking those chances have the double threat of robben and damien duff and things are looking good i just wonder if they lack a predator particularly with didier drogba injured he was starting to look the part before he was sidelined but you have to feel if chelsea had a ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the champions league i felt they would never have a better chance than last season but they have swept all before them in europe so far this season it will now be very interesting to see how mourinho prioritises things but his life will be made easier by the size of chelseas squad i have said i believed chelsea would win the league this season even when arsenal were flying at the start and i have seen nothing to make me change me mind if anything what i have seen has confirmed my early impressions and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenals rocky defensive display at spurs even though they ran out 54 winners mourinho had his say on that game complaining fivefour is a hockey score not a football score in a threeagainstthree training match if the score reaches 54 i send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly so to get a result like that in a game of 11 against 11 is disgraceful on a more serious note it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of sol campbell to arsenal much criticism has been aimed at pascal cygan but i believe the problem lies with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenals defence confidence is a crucial factor in defending when you start conceding goals you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area you think oh no then find your worst fears confirmed arsenal need to reverse the process with or without campbell and get some clean sheets on the board but the return of campbell is key he solidifies the unit has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck he is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit chelsea have no such problems at present which is why i would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season

athletics-48#what now for kelly holmes last april kelly holmes spoke to the bbc sport website about her loneliness her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the olympics it just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them four months later holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made a dame won the bbc sport personality of the year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes with so much time spent in the spotlight holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead the 34yearold has repeatedly chosen to tick the dont know box holmes has now pulled out of this weekends european indoor championships where she was selected for both the 800m and 1500m because of a hamstring injury but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore well its a lot easier being the double olympic champion being feted by everybody than training to be at the top in middle distance running points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram you have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if youre very talented holmes drive and determination have always been unquestionable that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career emptyhanded but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself will i have as much commitment desire and energy to go through a major championship holmes asked in the new year that is what i dont know at 34 holmes will also be aware that time is running out us 400m and 200m legend michael johnson a fivetime olympic gold medallist retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did britains double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson the physical demands of the daytoday grind will only get harder for holmes who has already admitted she doesnt like the training anymore whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double olympic champion will spur her opponents on holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race she will not step onto the track but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer there are more prizes up for grabs the day after completing her double in athens the 34yearold revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title holmes wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled such as a first gold at the world championships in helsinki there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes motivation the realisation that no matter how hard she trains nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens on the other hand if those achievements cannot be matched shouldnt they be at least shared and celebrated you dont get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion agreed cram you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because its a fantastic feeling i think deep down kelly wants to run i think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the newlook kelly holmes tearing up the track again after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire so why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where when or whether to even bother competing again thats just kelly explains cram shes always been like that she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next she knows every time she makes a pronouncement now its headline news kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions whether she can be competitive if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line and if she decides not to run again noone is going to turn round and say youre making the wrong decision

rugby-69#a november to remember last saturday one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world that statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion with australias triumph in london followed by frances capitulation to new zealand clearly there is no number one side in the world at the moment declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney there are four five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1 while that bodes well for rugby as a whole it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for a decade while the wallabies all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super 12 matters in the new year europes finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray and for the first time in more than a decade it will not simply be a straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title that owes much to irelands continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays who secured a first triple crown in 19 years last season could go one better and win their first fivesix nations title since 1985 they start with away games against italy and scotland before england and france come to lansdowne road their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster irelands selfbelief while ronan ogaras late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie osullivans side can now close out tight games not that england or france who have won nine of the last 10 six nations titles between them will lay down quietly dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio they still have the personnel to prosper the narrow defeat to australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden but the fresh shoots of postworld cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson a fresh desire to regain former heights is evident and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff a fourth title in six years is within reach are in familiar revival territory but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style while south africas overconfidence in cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory if mike ruddock can coax a reliable setpiece platform from his pack there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february the last fortnight has left in a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over australia a stunning defeat to argentina their first loss since the world cup could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency but the manner of new zealands 456 demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard fortunately for the french the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining in paris after two reasonable performances against australia the scots humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations a lack of topclass players will continue to undermine their best efforts who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february

football-84#benitez delight after crucial win liverpool manager rafael benitez admitted victory against deportivo la coruna was vital in their tight champions league group jorge andrades early own goal gave liverpool a 10 win and benitez said we started at a very high tempo and had many chances it is a very important win for us and we could have scored more goals we were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack we are pleased but move on to the next game igor biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured xabi alonso and benitez said he played very well it is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level benitez added it is all back in our own hands now it was a great win for us and i was delighted with what i feel was the best liverpool i have seen as far as my feelings about winning in spain that is really not important i want to see us win away matches in the champions league that it was in spain was not my first consideration as far as i am concerned it is important for liverpool to win it is not important in what country it is in benitez added benitez said we had a problem before the start it was decided that xabi could not play more than 45 minutes but in the end because of the way that dietmar hamann and igor biscan performed we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match depor are a good team and if you allow them to keep possession they can be very dangerous indeed but we knew that if we hit them on the counterattack it would make them nervous and that is how it worked out deportivo coach javier irureta said liverpool played very well and we just could not break them down i know we have now gone six games at home in europe without scoring but that does not reflect our overall performances but this time we did not play well and we lacked imagination the goal was a bad mistake and a big blow to our confidence players who usually want the ball at that stage did not want it i know we are bottom of the group but as long as there is hope of qualifying we will hang on to that

rugby-104#celts savour grand slam prospect the six nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and wales and ireland rather than traditional big guns france and england face a potential grand slam playoff in three weeks time but before that game in cardiff wales must get past scotland at murrayfield while ireland face the not insignificant task of a home fixture with the mercurial french noone knows what mood france will be in at lansdowne road on 12 march sublime as in the first half against wales or ridiculous like in the same period against england at twickenham but how the mighty have fallen england sat on rugbys summit 15 months ago as world champions and 2003 grand slam winners but they have lost nine of their 14 matches since that heady night in sydney and they face the ignominy of what could amount to a wooden spoon playoff against italy in a fortnight england are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain richard hill was dumped in favour of mike harrison after three straight losses in 1987 coach andy robinson who took over from the successful sir clive woodward in september has lost a phalanx of world cup stars and he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with a new team the same year that england ruled the roost a woeful wales lost all five matches in the six nations and they won only two games against scotland and italy in 2004 wales most recent championship title was in 1994 and their last grand slam success came in 1978 in the era of gareth edwards phil bennett jpr williams et al but welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of a new golden age after several false dawns coach mike ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations the fresh verve is inspired by skipper gareth thomas now out with a broken thumb accurate kicking from either flyhalf stephen jones or centre gavin henson a rampant martyn williams leading the way up front and exciting runners in the guise of henson and shane williams ireland coach eddie osullivan and captain brian odriscoll have got their side buzzing too and they are close to shedding the nearlymen tag that has dogged them for the past few years the men from the emerald isle have been six nations runnersup for the past two years to france and england but they have not won the title since 1985 and last clinched a grand slam in 1948 as for scotland they have struggled this decade and the 2004 wooden spoon winners have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in 1999 italy continue the elusive search for their first six nations away win and can still only account for the scalps of scotland twice and wales since joining the elite in 2000 coach john kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the azzurri but is lacking in raw materials and so to france brilliant one minute inept the next but the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in dublin and end up winning the title through the back door ireland though have won three times in their last five meetings welsh romantics would probably prefer a glorious victory in the celtic showdown to crown their grand slam but given that ireland have beaten wales in four of their last five meetings the welsh legions are likely to be behind les bleus on 12 march

rugby-110#a year to remember for irish there used to be one subliminal moment during a year in irish rugby that stood out more than most well at least there used to one now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction and sorrow it has been quite a year for the irish and not just with eddie osullivans triple crown winning international outfit either right down through the ranks irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game but most of the kudos will go to osullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for 29 years but also finished their autumn campaign with a 100 record for the second year in succession they also finished in the runnersup spot in the rbs six nations but in the three games in november which included a victory over trinations champions and grand slam chasing south africa ireland finsihed the year on a high the 1812 victory at lansdowne road was only their second victory over the boks after the initial success back in 1965 that success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in blomefontein and cape town in the summer those two reverses and the 3517 flop against france were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent 12 months but the big one of course was the 1913 defeat of world cup champions england on their precious twickenham turf the winning try was conceived in osullivans mind perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey for me the try of the championship osullivans career is now in vertical takeoff mode it is no wonder that sir clive woodward has elevated the galwaybased coach to head the lions test side not only that but a fair majority of the present ireland side will be wearing red next june in new zealand there can be no doubt that irelands representation will be the biggest ever albeit in a proposed 44man squad in brian odriscoll and paul oconnell ireland have now the two frontrunners for the captaincy gordon darcy whose career began as a teenager back in 1999 finally arrived when he was named the six nations player of the tournament but it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to ireland the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well the under21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by a powerful all black side in the decider the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runnersup to england in the six nations under21 tournament on the provincial front leinster for second year in succession blew it when the heineken cup looked a good wager while ulster finished runnersup in their very tight group for the second season in succession it was munster again flying the flag for the irish looking to reach their third final they went down 3732 to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road how wasps recovered from that energysapping duel and then go onto to defeat toulouse in the final was anybodys guess ulster meanwhile just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game ulster however took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall the once famous ravenhill fortress was breached four times as ulster only manged five wins from their first 12 outings in the celtic league leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into 2005 but whether they can take that final step under declan kidney is another thing on the down side irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under19 world cup game in durban that happened only 10 days after he led royal armagh to their first ulster schools cup success since 1977 the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in a car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity a larger than life character doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in 1985 the last time that goal had been achieved before this season ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of wellknown londonderry ym player jim huey coleraines jonathan hutchinson and belfast harlequins lock johnny poole they all passed away long before the fulltime whistle
